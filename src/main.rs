// Part I
/* This is actually my first project with rust. I have known Rust from articles and 
   former colleages who started recently switching to Rust, therefore that pushed me to 
   learn more about it. I have encountered many of the concepts from my C++ experience
   in Autosar that are being used on a regular basis like Result, Option... I used couple
   of times match, impl, struct, enum, mut and few of times, .clone, .unwrap. */

/* I used cargo to manage the packages seamlessly though pachages and created libs. */
/* I would give myself a rate of 5.5 as there are certainly more advanced topics that still
   I did not explore with rust! Nevertheless, I am quite confident to work in depth with 
   Rust. If given the opportunity, Iâ€™ll ramp up quickly, contribute meaningfully, and
   keep leveling up my Rust expertise. */

/* For clarity, I created four seperate libraries to get the best effective approach to 
   perform a working functional solution. They are: DataFetscher, HashTable, Keys, Trading. */
