This is actually my first project with rust. I have known Rust from articles and former colleages who started recently switching to Rust, therefore that pushed me to learn more about it. I have encountered many of the concepts from my C++ experience in Autosar that are being used on a regular basis like Result, Option... I used couple of times match, impl, struct, enum, mut and few of times, .clone, .unwrap.

I used cargo to manage the packages seamlessly though pachages and created libs.

For clarity, I created four seperate libraries to get the best effective approach to perform a working functional solution. They are: DataFetscher, HashTable, Keys, Trading.
